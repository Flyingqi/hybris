#Caching DTO beans with Spring cache and Redis

#Motivation
Hybris creates a lot of new DTO beans object every time when you access the storefront.
This impedes the responsive time and creates a lot os small short-live objects. 
This also gives the JVM high pressure to do the garbage collection.
You can consult the topic: converters and populators to get more info.
